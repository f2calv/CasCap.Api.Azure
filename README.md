# CasCap.Api.Azure

A collection of helper class libraries used when interacting with Azure PaaS.

## Development

To work on this solution with Visual Studio also clone [CasCap.Common](https://github.com/f2calv/CasCap.Common) to the same directory level.

To run the tests you will also need Azurite storage emulator;

```bash
docker run -p 10000:10000 -p 10001:10001 -p 10002:10002 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite
```
